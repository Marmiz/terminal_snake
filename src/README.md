# Terminal Snake

A simple snake Game that runs inside the terminal.

Made with [rustbox](https://github.com/gchp/rustbox), Rust's termbox implementation.

```
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```

## TODOS

Handle terminal resize resize.

## Limitations

Snake feels like running faster in vertical.

Snake is thicker when moving horizontally.
